1,Adaptive Mobile Cloud Computing to Enable Rich Mobile Multimedia Applications,"With worldwide shipments of smartphones (487.7 million) exceeding PCs (414.6 million including tablets) in 2011 [1], and in the US alone, more users predicted to access the Internet from mobile devices than from PCs by 2015 [2], clearly there is a desire to be able to use mobile devices and networks like we use PCs and wireline networks today. However, in spite of advances in the capabilities of mobile devices, a gap will continue to exist, and may even widen, with the requirements of rich multimedia applications. Mobile cloud computing can help bridge this gap, providing mobile applications the capabilities of cloud servers and storage together with the benefits of mobile devices and mobile connectivity, possibly enabling a new generation of truly ubiquitous multimedia applications on mobile devices: Cloud Mobile Media (CMM) applications.","S Wang, S Dey ",IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,Journal Article,2013,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,

3,Adaptive Code Offloading for Mobile Cloud Applications: Exploiting Fuzzy Sets and Evidence-based Learning,"Mobile cloud computing is arising as a prominent domain that is seeking to bring the massive advantages of the cloud to the resource constrained smartphones, by following a delegation or offloading criteria. In a delegation model, a mobile device consumes services from multiple clouds by efficiently utilizing solutions like middleware. In the offloading model, a mobile application is partitioned and analyzed so that the most computational expensive operations at code level can be identified and offloaded for remote processing. While code offloading is studied extensively for the development of mobile cloud applications, much of the advantages of cloud computing are still left unexploited and poorly considered in these approaches. Cloud computing may introduce many other dynamic variables like performance metrics, parallelization of tasks, elasticity etc., to current code offloading models that could affect the overall offloading decision process. To address this, we propose a fuzzy decision engine for code offloading, that considers both mobile and cloud variables. The cloud parameters and rules are introduced asynchronously to the mobile, using notification services. The paper also proposes a strategy to enrich the offloading decision process with evidence-based learning methods, by exploiting cloud processing capabilities over code offloading traces.","H Flores, S Srirama",Proceeding of the Fourth ACM Workshop on Mobile Cloud Computing and Services,Conference Paper,2013,Query,yes,yes,no,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,,Not sure about self-adaptation
4,Adaptive Blocker Rejection Continuous-TimeΣΔADC for Mobile WiMAX Applications,"An adaptive blocker-rejection wideband continuous-time (CT) sigma-delta (SigmaDelta) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is presented. An integrated blocker detector reconfigures the ADC loop architecture to avoid overloading in the presence of strong interferers, improving receiver channel selectivity and sensitivity without increasing its dynamic range (DR) requirements. The adaptive operation relaxes receiver baseband channel filtering requirements for a worldwide inter-operability for microwave access (WiMAX, IEEE 802.16e) receiver. The ADC achieves 71 dB of dynamic range (DR), 65 dB of peak SNDR and 68 dB of peak SNR over a 10 MHz signal bandwidth, consuming 18 mW from a 1.2 V supply. The ADC system reconfigures the loop filter topology within 51 mus, improving receiver selectivity without any transient impact on BER. In the blocker suppression mode, the ADC can withstand 30 dBc blocker at the adjacent channel, achieving - 22 dB error vector magnitude (EVM) with a 24 Mb/s 16-QAM signal. The IC is fabricated on a 130 nm 8-level metal, metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor, CMOS technology, occupying 1.5 times 0.9 mm2silicon area.","H Kim, J Lee, T Copani, S Bazarjani, S Kiaei, B Bakkaloglu",IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits,Journal Article,2009,Query,yes,yes,no,,x,,,,,,,-,
5,"Adaptive control of four-wheel-steering off-road mobile robots: Application to path tracking and heading control in presence of sliding
","In this paper, automatic path tracking of a four-wheel-steering vehicle in presence of sliding is addressed. The attractive feature of such a steering system is that, despite of sliding phenomena, both lateral and angular deviations can be explicitly controlled. Indeed, previous research has demonstrated that high-precision path tracking on a low grip terrain can be achieved with two-wheel-steering vehicles. However, in this case, only the lateral deviation is kept satisfactorily close to zero, the angular deviation is non null in order to compensate for sliding effects. In this paper, previous adaptive control laws are extended to the case of four-wheel-steering mobile robots with the aim to servo both lateral and angular deviations. Relying on an extended kinematic model, a backstepping control approach, which considers successively front and rear steering control, has been designed. Real world experiments have been carried out on a low adherent terrain with a four-wheel-steering vehicle equipped with a single RTK-GPS. This demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed control law and its robustness in real all-terrain conditions.","C Cariou, R Lenain, B Thuilot, P Martinet",2008 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,Conference Paper,2008,Query,yes,,,,x,,,,,,,-,
6,Distributed adaptive control for consensus tracking with application to formation control of nonholonomic mobile robots,"In this paper, we investigate the output consensus problem of tracking a desired trajectory for a class of systems consisting of multiple nonlinear subsystems with intrinsic mismatched unknown parameters. The subsystems are allowed to have non-identical dynamics, whereas with similar structures and the same yet arbitrary system order. Suppose that the communications among the subsystems can be represented by a directed graph. Diﬀerent from the traditional centralized tracking control problem, only a subset of the subsystems can obtain the desired trajectory information directly. A distributed adaptive control approach based on backstepping technique is proposed. By introducing the estimates to account for the parametric uncertainties of the desired trajectory and its neighbors’ dynamics into the local controller of each subsystem, the information exchanges of online parameter estimates and local synchronization errors among linked subsystems can be avoided. It is proved that the boundedness of all closed-loop signals and the asymptotically consensus tracking for all the subsystems’ outputs are ensured. In simulation studies, a numerical example is illustrated to show the eﬀectiveness of the proposed control scheme. Moreover, the design strategy is successfully applied to solve a formation control problem for multiple nonholonomic mobile robots.","W Wang, J Huang ,C Wen, H Fan",Automatica,Journal Article,2014,Query,yes,,,,x,,,,,,,,
7,Towards Context-aware and Resource-driven Self-adaptation for Mobile Handheld Applications,"Mobile handheld computing is gaining momentum as more and more wireless handheld devices are being used to accomplish various computing tasks. Context-awareness can help to adapt and personalize applications or to optimize resource usage. However, many existing context infrastructures by themselves impose heavy resource requirements for deployment or highly affect the limited autonomy of the mobile device. In this paper we describe how resource-driven self-adaptation is used in our layered context-driven application middleware in order to enable deployment on a mobile device and optimize resource usage. Our evaluation shows that the introspection and intercession capabilities of the self-adapting middleware provide the necessary flexibility to achieve a balanced resource usage between the context-driven application middleware and the context-aware applications, and that the resource-driven self-adaptation is able to more than double the battery lifetime in real life scenarios."," D Preuveneers, Y Berbers ",Proceedings of the 2007 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,Conference Paper,2007,Query,yes,yes,no,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,,

Among all such major changes mobile learning is the latest to happen with the advent of mobile learning technologies that have the potential to revolutionize distance education by bringing the concept of anytime and anywhere to reality. From the learner’s perceptive, mobile learning is “any sort of leaning that happens when the learner is not at a fixed, pre-determined location or learning that happens when the learner takes advantage of learning opportunities offered by mobile technologies”. Research in context aware mobile learning has concentrated on how to adapt applications to context.

While mobile application users expect the application to be reliable and secure, the complexity of the mobile application makes it prone to have faults. Mobile application engineers and testers use testing technique to ensure the quality of mobile application. However, the testing of mobile application is time-consuming and hard to automate. In this paper, we model the mobile application from a black box view and propose a distance metric for the test cases of mobile software. We further proposed an ART test case generation technique for mobile application. Our experiment shows our ART tool can both reduce the number of test cases and the time needed to expose first fault when compared with random technique.","Z Liu, X Gao, X Long",IEEE - 2010 2nd International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology,Conference Paper,2010,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,
11,Playing MUSIC — building context-aware and self-adaptive mobile applications,"Although the idea of context-awareness was introduced almost two decades ago, few mobile software applications are available today that can sense and adapt to their run-time environment. The development of context-aware and self-adaptive applications is complex and few developers have experience in this area. On the basis of several demonstrators built by the joint European research project MUSIC, this paper describes typical context and adaptation features relevant for the development of context-aware and self-adaptive mobile applications. We explain how the demonstrators were realised using the open-source platform MUSIC and present the feedback of the developers of these demonstrators. The main contribution of this paper is to show how the development complexity of context-aware and self-adaptive mobile applications can be mastered by using an adaptation framework such as MUSIC.

13,Bandwidth-adaptive partitioning for distributed execution optimization of mobile applications,"Mobile applications are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and provide ever richer functionality on mobile devices, while such applications drain increasingly more battery power of mobile devices. Offloading some parts of the application running on mobile devices onto remote servers/clouds is a promising approach to extend the battery life of mobile devices. However, as data transmission of offloading causes delay and energy costs for mobile devices, it is necessary to carefully design application partitioning/offloading schemes to weigh the benefits against the transmission delay and costs. Due to bandwidth fluctuations in the wireless environment, static partitionings in previous work are unsuitable for mobile platforms with a fixed bandwidth assumption, while dynamic partitionings result in high overhead of continuous partitioning for mobile devices. Therefore, we propose a novel partitioning scheme taking the bandwidth as a variable to improve static partitioning and avoid high costs of dynamic partitioning. Firstly, we construct application Object Relation Graphs (ORGs) by combining static analysis and dynamic profiling to propose partitioning optimization models. Then based on our novel execution-time and energy optimization partitioning models, we propose the Branch-and-Bound based Application Partitioning (BBAP) algorithm and Min-Cut based Greedy Application Partitioning (MCGAP) algorithm. BBAP is suited to finding the optimal partitioning solutions for small applications, while MCGAP is applicable to quickly obtaining suboptimal solutions for large-scale applications. Experimental results demonstrate that both algorithms can adapt to bandwidth fluctuations well, and significantly reduce application execution time and energy consumption by optimally distributing components between mobile devices and servers.","J Niu, W Song, M Atiquzzaman",Journal of Network and Computer Applications,Journal Article,2014,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,
14,XMobile: A MB-UID environment for semi-automatic generation of adaptive applications for mobile devices,"Ubiquitous Computing promises seamless access to information anytime, anywhere with different and heterogeneous devices. This kind of environment imposes new challenges to software development. For example, information and user interface should be adapted according to contextual characteristics such as user, environment, and access device. In case of device adaptation, the development challenge is related to the heterogeneity of the devices, which requires software engineers to create different versions for each type of device and every platform. This paper proposes a MB-UID (model-based user interface development) approach for semi-automatic generation of adaptive applications for mobile devices. An environment, called XMobile, offers a device-independent user interface framework and a code generation tool for providing fast development of multi-platform and adaptive applications according to device and platform features. A case study is also presented to illustrate how the environment can be used for constructing an application for heterogeneous devices with different network connectivity modes.","W Viana, R M.C.

15,Enabling Adaptive High-Frame-Rate Video Streaming in Mobile Cloud Gaming Applications,"High-frame-rate (HFR) video is emerging in popular gaming applications to enhance the smooth experience perceived by end users. However, it is challenging to guarantee the delivery quality of HFR video in mobile cloud gaming scenarios because of the high transmission rate and limited wireless resources. To address this critical problem, we develop a novel transmission scheduling framework dubbed AdaPtive HFR vIdeo Streaming (APHIS). The term adaptive indicates this scheme's capability in dynamically adjusting the video traffic load and forward error correction (FEC) coding. First, we propose an online video frame selection algorithm to minimize the total distortion based on the network status, input video data, and delay constraint. Second, we introduce an unequal FEC coding scheme to provide differentiated protection for Intra (I) and Predicted (P) frames with low-latency cost. The proposed APHIS framework is able to appropriately filter video frames and adjust data protection levels to optimize the quality of HFR video streaming. We conduct extensive emulations in Exata involving HFR video encoded with H.264 codec. Experimental results show that APHIS outperforms the reference transmission schemes in terms of video peak signal-to-noise ratio, end-to-end delay, and goodput. Therefore, we recommend APHIS for delivering HFR video streaming in mobile cloud gaming systems.",Jiyan Wu ; Chau Yuen ; Ngai-Man Cheung ; Junliang Chen ; Chang Wen Chen,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology,Journal Article,2015,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,
16,An Aspect Oriented Middleware Architecture for Adaptive Mobile Computing Applications,"Mobile computing applications are required to operate in environments in which the availability for resources and services may change significantly during system operation. Thus, mobile computing applications need to be capable of adapting to these changes to offer the best possible level of service to their users. However, traditional middleware is limited in its capability of adapting to the environment changes and different users requirements. Aspect Oriented Programming has been used in the design and implementation of adaptive middleware architectures. In this paper, we propose an adaptive middleware architecture which can be used to develop adaptive mobile applications. Such architecture is compared to a component-based architecture from a quantitative perspective. The results suggest that middleware based on this model can be used to build mobile adaptive applications that require only a very small overhead in terms of running time as well as memory footprint while producing code that is more ease to comprehend and modify.",Celso Maciel da Costa ; Marcelo da Silva Strzykalski ; Guy Bernard,31st Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC 2007),Conference Paper,2007,Query,yes,no,no,,x,,,,,,,,
17,RFID tag localization by using adaptive neuro‐fuzzy inference for mobile robot applications,"Purpose
– The purpose of this paper is to address the use of passive RFID technology for the development of an autonomous surveillance robot. Passive RFID tags can be used for labelling both valued objects and goal‐positions that the robot has to reach in order to inspect the surroundings. In addition, the robot can use RFID tags for navigational purposes, such as to keep track of its pose in the environment. Automatic tag position estimation is, therefore, a fundamental task in this context.

Design/methodology/approach
– The paper proposes a supervised fuzzy inference system to learn the RFID sensor model; Then the obtained model is used by the tag localization algorithm. Each tag position is estimated as the most likely among a set of candidate locations.

Findings
– The paper proves the feasibility of RFID technology in a mobile robotics context. The development of a RFID sensor model is first required in order to provide a functional relationship between the spatial attitude of the device and its responses. Then, the RFID device provided with this model can be successfully integrated in mobile robotics applications such as navigation, mapping and surveillance, just to mention a few.

Originality/value
– The paper presents a novel approach to RFID sensor modelling using adaptive neuro‐fuzzy inference. The model uses both Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) and tag detection event in order to achieve better accuracy. In addition, a method for global tag localization is proposed. Experimental results prove the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach.

19,"A framework for context-aware self-adaptive mobile applications SPL
","Mobile Applications are rapidly emerging as a convenient medium for using a variety of services. Over time and with the high penetration of smartphones in society, self-adaptation has become an essential capability required by mobile application users. In an ideal scenario, an application is required to adjust its behavior according to the current context of its use. This raises the challenge in mobile computing towards the design and development of applications that sense and react to contextual changes to provide a value-added user experience. In its general sense, context information can relate to the environment, the user, or the device status. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for building context aware and adaptive mobile applications. Based on feature modeling and Software Product Lines (SPL) concepts, this framework guides the modeling of adaptability at design time and supports context awareness and adaptability at runtime. In the core of the approach, is a feature meta-model that incorporates, in addition to SPL concepts, application feature priorities to drive the adaptability. A tool, based on that feature model, is presented to model the mobile application features and to derive the SPL members. A mobile framework, built on top of OSGI framework to dynamically adapt the application at runtime is also described.","Rabeb Mizouni, Mohammad AbuMatar, Zaid AlMahmoud, Salwa Alzahmi, Aziz Salah",Expert Systems with Applications,Journal Article,2014,Query,yes,yes,no,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,,-

23,SAMPLES: Self Adaptive Mining of Persistent LExical Snippets for Classifying Mobile Application Traffic,"We present SAMPLES: Self Adaptive Mining of Persistent LExical Snippets; a systematic framework for classifying network traffic generated by mobile applications. SAMPLES constructs conjunctive rules, in an automated fashion, through a supervised methodology over a set of labeled flows (the training set). Each conjunctive rule corresponds to the lexical context, associated with an application identifier found in a snippet of the HTTP header, and is defined by: (a) the identifier type, (b) the HTTP header-field it occurs in, and (c) the prefix/suffix surrounding its occurrence. Subsequently, these conjunctive rules undergo an aggregate-and-validate step for improving accuracy and determining a priority order. The refined rule-set is then loaded into an application-identification engine where it operates at a per flow granularity, in an extract-and-lookup paradigm, to identify the application responsible for a given flow. Thus, SAMPLES can facilitate important network measurement and management tasks --- e.g. behavioral profiling [29], application-level firewalls [21,22] etc. --- which require a more detailed view of the underlying traffic than that afforded by traditional protocol/port based methods. We evaluate SAMPLES on a test set comprising 15 million flows (approx.) generated by over 700 K applications from the Android, iOS and Nokia market-places. SAMPLES successfully identifies over 90% of these applications with 99% accuracy on an average. This, in spite of the fact that fewer than 2% of the applications are required during the training phase, for each of the three market places. This is a testament to the universality and the scalability of our approach. We, therefore, expect SAMPLES to work with reasonable coverage and accuracy for other mobile platforms --- e.g. BlackBerry and Windows Mobile --- as well.","H Yao, G Ranjan, A Tongaonkar, Y Liao, Z M Mao",Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking,Conference Paper,2015,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,
24,Adaptive application offloading using distributed abstract class graphs in mobile environments,"Self-adaptation of software has been used as a mechanism to address complexity and constraint in mobile and pervasive computing environments. Adaptive offloading is a software adaptation mechanism in which an application dynamically distributes portions of itself to remote devices to achieve context specific optimizations. The feasibility of using adaptive offloading in pervasive environments is determined by the computational efficiency of adaptation algorithms and the efficacy of their decisions. However, existing state-of-the-art approaches incur overheads from storing, updating and partitioning complete application graphs on each device, which limits their utility and scalability in resource constrained mobile environments. Hence, this paper presents a novel distributed approach to application representation in which each device maintains a graph consisting only of components in its memory space, while maintaining abstraction elements for components in remote devices. This approach removes the need to store and update complete application graphs on each device and reduces the cost of partitioning an application during adaptation. In addition, an extension to an existing application graph partitioning heuristic is proposed to utilize this representation approach. An evaluation involving computationally heavy open-source applications adapting in a heterogeneous collaboration showed that the new approach reduced graph update network cost by 100%, collaboration-wide memory cost by between 37% and 50%, power usage by between 63% and 93%, and adaptation time by between 19.47% and 98%, while improving efficacy of adaptation by 12% and 34% for two of the considered applications.","E Abebe, C Ryan","Journal of Systems and Software, 2012 - Elsevier",Journal Article,2012,Query,yes,yes,no,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,,

26,Adaptive DRX configuration to optimize device power saving and latency of mobile applications over LTE advanced network,"Discontinuous reception (DRX) can be configured as a power saving mechanism for user equipment (UE) in connected mode in the long term evolution advanced (LTE-A) network. Since DRX saves UE's battery power usually at the cost of increased latency, a tradeoff between these two conflicting performance metrics are inevitable. DRX parameters can be optimized for either maximizing power saving or minimizing latency based on the applications running at the UE. In this paper, we first develop an analytical model to estimate power saving achieved and latency incurred by DRX operation. We then propose a scheme to tune DRX parameters in order to keep a balance between these conflicting performance metrics by formulating a multi-objective optimization problem. The tradeoff between power saving and latency is achieved based on the operator's relative preferences for these metrics. We also validate our analytical model by system level simulation results from OPNET Modeler. OPNET simulation results are well aligned with the MATLAB results based on analytical model and the results show that proposed scheme efficiently optimizes the DRX configuration for the battery power saving and latency requirements of various diverse data applications based on the preferences determined by operator.",Satish C.

The average spectral efficiency and packet loss rate of the joint C-ARQ and AMC scheme are first derived in closed form. Aiming to maximize the system spectral efficiency, AMC schemes for the S-D and R-D links are optimized, whereas a prescribed packet-loss-rate constraint is satisfied. As an interesting application, joint link adaptation and blockage mitigation in land mobile satellite communications (LMSC) with temporally correlated channels is then investigated. In LMSC, the S node data can be delivered to the D node when the S-D is in the outage, therefore provisioning the QoS requirements. For applications without instantaneous feedback, an optimized rate selection scheme based on the channel statistics is also devised. Detailed and insightful numerical results are presented, which indicate the superior performance of the proposed joint AMC and C-ARQ schemes over their optimized joint AMC and traditional ARQ counterparts.","M Mardani, JS Harsini, F Lahouti, B Eliasi",IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,Journal Article,2011,Query,yes,yes,no,,x,,,,,,,-,

","This paper reports on the design and development of a mobile application to support archaeological education and to raise awareness for our cultural heritage by making use of the powerful notion of play. The application reads information from Quick-Response Codes (QR-Codes) on paper sheets, which can be placed directly at the points of interest. Users can now follow an archaeological scavenger hunt along those points of interest. They start at one point of interest and get hints on how to find the others. This makes use of collective intelligence, i.e. using the mobile devices amongst the group of users as social communicators in order to get specific information on the target; through these additional discussions both the one who states questions and the one who gets the answer can learn incidentally. Although this App has been developed for educational purposes, it can be used just for fun, e.g. for a children's birthday party: Hiding treasures in various spots in the garden and delivering information on QR-codes showing hints on how to find the spots. Moreover, the use of the ArchaeoApp in the Tourism modus, is a challenge for e-Business.","K Holzinger, M Lehner, M Fassold, A Holzinger",Proceedings of the International Conference on e-Business,Conference Paper,2011,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,

The architecture of CAAAs is typically layered and incorporates a context-awareness component to support processing of context values and triggering of adaptive changes. While this layered architecture is very natural for the design and implementation of CAAAs, it exhibits new kinds of failures that arise as a result of faults that are specific to the choice of technology for specific layers. In this paper we investigate the occurrence of such faults and failures that manifest across architectural layers, and we describe samples of such failures in four CAAAs.","M Sama, DS Rosenblum, Z Wang, S Elbaum ",Journal of Systems and Software,Journal Article,2010,Query,yes,yes,no,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,,"It looks like a position paper format, careful with the data extraction.

35,CloudAware: A Context-Adaptive Middleware for Mobile Edge and Cloud Computing Applications,"The widespread use of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets is accompanied by an ever increasing market for mobile applications, including resource demanding services like speech-or face recognition, that formerly were restricted to stationary devices. But as mobile devices remain comparatively limited in terms of resources (e.g., computation, storage and battery life), current approaches for augmentation have advocated the integration of cloud servers as well as other nearby devices to provide scalable computation-and storage resources to mobile end users. A current solution is the so-called computation offloading, which is the most prominent strategy used in Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) and its successor known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). While MCC and MEC are receiving increasing attention, current work is often not able to cope with the quickly and constantly changing context (e.g., intermittent connectivity) of mobile devices. Therefore, this paper presents the evaluation of CloudAware, a context-adaptive mobile middleware for MCC as well as MEC that supports automated context adaptation by linking the distribution features of mobile middleware with context-aware self-adaptation techniques. In particular, we present a system software infrastructure and a data mining process which facilitate the development of elastic, scalable and context-adaptive mobile applications and present their evaluation using real usage data provided by the Nokia Mobile Data Challenge (MDC) dataset.","G Orsini, D Bade, W Lamersdorf ",2016 IEEE 1st International Workshops on Foundations and Applications of Self* Systems (FAS*W),Conference Paper,2016,Query,yes,yes,no,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,,

The frame rate of real-time graphics applications fluctuates due to continual changes in the LoD, visibility and distance of scene objects, user interactivity, complexity of lighting and animation, and many other factors. Such frame rate spikes waste precious battery energy. We introduce an adaptive CPU scheduler that predicts the applications workload from frame to frame and allocates just enough CPU cycles to render the scene at a target rate of 25 FPS. Since the applications workload needs to be re-estimated whenever the scenes LoD changes, we integrate our CPU scheduler with LoD management. To further save energy, we try to render scenes at the lowest LoD at which the user does not see visual artifacts on a given screen. Our integrated Energy-efficient Adaptive Real-time Rendering (EARR) heuristic reduces energy consumption by up to 60% while maintaining acceptable image quality at interactive frame rates.","F Wu, E Agu, C Lindsay "," International Symposium on Visual Computing, 2008 - Springer - Advances in Visual Computing",Conference Paper,2008,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,

This new trend of applications are capable of tuning their behavior depending on changes observed in the surrounding environment. However, these adaptations are often restrained by the static features of the supporting middleware, which is not able to exploit the opportunities offered by the environment in order to improve the quality of the adaptations. The MUSIC platform offers a modular support maximizing the user satisfaction by adapting dynamically mobile applications. Beyond this support, the MUSIC platform can itself be adapted towards the evolving environment (e.g., location, network connectivity) in order to satisfy both the user requirements and the device properties. In this paper, we focus on three complementary approaches for adapting the MUSIC platform, namely i) the distribution of the adaptation process among the neighboring devices, ii) the assignment of the devices responsibilities, and iii) the adaptation of the platform components. Thus, MUSIC leverages the adaptation of mobile applications by changing autonomously the middleware characteristics.","R Rouvoy, M Beauvois, L Lozano, J Lorenzo, F Eliassen",Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Mobile Middleware: Embracing the Personal Communication Device,Conference Paper,2008,Query,yes,yes,no,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,,check

Controlling picture quality by modifying the quantization parameter (QP) is most widely used. But we demonstrate that reducing the spatial resolution is more effective in a low bit-rate environment, and we show how to find the optimal spatial resolution for the available bandwidth. Varying the spatial resolution is especially effective 1) when the bandwidth between the video encoder and the displaying device varies considerably with time, which is the case in wireless networks, and 2) when the display device is sensitive to energy saving. Both of these considerations are met by a portable media player which is displaying streaming video content transmitted by a remote video server through a wireless network.

","Today's worldwide mobile data traffic is roughly 18× larger than the full internet traffic in 2000, and continued large growth is expected. High mobile data usage has implications both for users and providers. For individual users, relying on cellular data connectivity incurs high cellular data fees. For cellular network providers, high mobile data usage requires expensive, ongoing infrastructure upgrades. Cellular data usage can be reduced by offloading to WiFi when available. If not available, prior work has considered delaying transmissions to wait for WiFi availability. While exploiting such application delay tolerance offers significant energy and performance leverage for data offloading and other techniques, a key question is: how long to wait? Prior work does not discuss how to estimate application delay tolerance without explicit help from programmers, nor how to adjust the estimate dynamically. This work proposes, implements, and evaluates four schemes to dynamically and adaptively deduce an application's delay tolerance. These schemes (Adaptive, Decision Tree-Based, Hybrid and Lazy) are low-overhead and effective. In our experiments, they cut cellular usage by 2× or more compared to non-delay-tolerant approaches. Furthermore, our dynamically adaptive decision schemes achieve up to 15% further cellular data reduction compared to fixed static delay tolerance values.","OB Yetim, M Martonosi",2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM),Conference Paper,2015,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,

63,A robust fault detection scheme with an application to mobile robots by using adaptive thresholds generated with locally linear models,"In a fault detection system, generating residuals is the first step in detecting faults. However, residuals are not the only element of a dependable fault detection system. A fault detection system is reliable when an appropriate residual evaluation criterion is used along with a suitable residual generation technique. In this paper, a new method for an adaptive threshold generation is proposed to improve evaluation of the residuals with application to a trajectory following of an unmanned mobile robot. The proposed solution is useful when local linear models are utilized as observers for residual generation. For this purpose, locally linear model tree algorithm equipped with an external dynamics is applied as a powerful nonlinear identifier scheme to model the system. To demonstrate the capability of our proposed concept a complete model of a two wheeled mobile robot which is capable of implementing most possible faults in the system is developed. Detailed simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed methodology.","F Baghernezhad, K Khorasani ",2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Control and Automation (CICA),Conference Paper,2013,Query,,,,,x,,,,,,,,

Service-Oriented Applications and Architectures (SOAs) have captured the interest of industry as a way to support business-to-business interaction, and the SOA market grew by $4.9 billion in 2005. SOAs and in particular service-oriented computing (SOC) represent a promising approach in the development of adaptive distributed systems. With SOC, applications can open themselves to services offered by third parties and accessed through standard, well-defined interfaces. The binding between the applications and the services can be, in this context, extremely loose--enabling the ad hoc creation of new services when the need arises. This book offers an overview of some current research in the field, presenting the results of eighteen research projects funded by the European Community's Information Society Technologies Program (IST). The projects, collaborations between industry and academia, have produced practical, achievable results that point the way to real-world applications and future research. The chapters address such issues as requirement analysis, design, governance, interoperability, and the dependability of systems made up of components owned by third parties. The results are presented in the context of two roadmaps for research, one developed by European industry involved in software development and the other by researchers working in the service area. The contributors report first on the ""Infrastructure Layer,"" then (in the bulk of the book) on the ""Service Integration Layer,"" the ""Semantic Layer,"" and finally on the issues that cut across the different layers.

","Modern society increasingly relies on mobile devices. This explains the growing demand for high quality software for such devices. To improve the efficiency of the development life-cycle, shortening time-to-market while keeping quality under control, mobile applications are typically developed by composing together ad-hoc developed components, services available on-line, and other third-party mobile applications. Applications are thus built as heterogeneous compositions, whose characteristics strongly depend on the components and services they integrate. To cope with unpredictable changes and failures, but also with the various settings offered by the plethora of available devices, mobile applications need to be as adaptive as possible. However, mainstream adaptation strategies are usually defined imperatively and require complex control strategies strongly intertwined with the application logic, yielding to applications that are difficult to build, maintain, and evolve. We address this issue by proposing a declarative approach to compose adaptive heterogeneous mobile applications. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated through an example inspired by an existing worldwide distributed mobile application, while the implementation of the proposed solution has been validated through a set of simulations and experiments aimed at illustrating its performance.","G Cugola, C Ghezzi, LS Pinto, G Tamburrelli ",Journal of Systems and Software,Journal Article,2014,Query,yes,yes,no,,,,,,x,,,,

70,A Framework for Adaptive RDF Graph Replication for Mobile SemanticWeb Applications:,"An increasing number of applications are based on Semantic Web technologies and the amount of information available on the Web in the form of RDF is continuously growing. The adaption of the Semantic Web for Personal Information Management and the increasing desire for mobility is often accompanied by situations where no network connectivity is available and hence access to remote data is limited. Such situations could be obviated when mobile devices are able to operate on oﬄine data replicas and synchronize changes when connectivity is re-established. In this paper we present our ongoing work in developing a framework allowing for adaptive RDF graph replication and synchronization on mobile devices. We propose to interpose components that analyze various information sources of semantic applications (including ontologies, queries, and expressed user interest) and use them for selecting parts of RDF data bases, which are then made available oﬄine using a proxy SPARQL endpoint on a mobile device. Thus, we provide access to Semantic Web data without the need for permanent network connectivity.","B Schandl, S Zander ",Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Advanced Technologies and Techniques for Enterprise Information Systems,Conference Paper,2009,Query,,,,,,,,,x,,,,
71,An adaptive duty-cycle scheme for GPS scheduling in mobile location sensing applications,"Mobile location sensing applications (MLSAs) represent an emerging genre of applications that exploit Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and facilitate location-based services. The design of MLSAs must incorporate a tradeoff between information accuracy and energy efﬁciency because GPS technology is energy expensive and unaffordable for most MLSA platforms, which are battery-powered and therefore resource-constrained. In this study, based on our observation that the reception of GPS signals is spatially and temporally correlated, we propose a novel algorithm called the Adaptive Duty Cycle (ADC) scheme to exploit the spatio-temporal localities in the design of GPS scheduling algorithms. Using a comprehensive set of evaluations, as well as realistic hiker mobility traces, we evaluate the ADC scheme in terms of data granularity and power consumption. The results demonstrate that the scheme can achieve the Pareto optimum in all test cases. Moreover, the scheme is simple, effective, and generalizable to other mobile location sensing applications.","CL Wu, YT Huang, CL Wu, H Chu, P Huang, LJ Chen",Proc. of PhoneSense,NA,2011,Query,yes,yes,no,,x,,,,,,,,

The main contribution of the algorithm is that the numerical integration method based on cubature rule is directly used to calculate the SLAM posterior probability density. To improve innovation covariance and cross-covariance, the latest measurements are iteratively used in the measurement updating. The algorithm can reduce linearization error and improve the accuracy of the SLAM algorithm. The algorithm also used adaptive iterating estimation restricted by the iterative sentencing guideline to adjust the proportion of the observation and dynamic model, to make the estimated square root of the error covariance more accurate and reasonable. In experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with Extended Kalman Filter based SLAM algorithm (EKF-SLAM), Unscented Kalman Filter based SLAM algorithm (UKF-SLAM) and Square-Root Cubature Kalman Filter based SLAM algorithm (SRCKF-SLAM. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm having with the higher accuracy of the state estimation is obtained to compare with the EKF-SLAM algorithm, the UKFSLAM algorithm and the SRCKF-SLAM algorithm.","Z Chen, X Dai, L Jiang, C Yang, B Cai",TELKOMNIKA Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering,Journal Article,2013,Query,yes,no,no,,x,,,,,,,,

Modern cellphones are equipped with multiple context sensors used by increasingly sophisticated software applications that exploit the sensors, allowing the applications to adapt automatically to changes in the surrounding environment, such as by responding to the location and speed of the user. The architecture of such applications is typically layered and incorporates a context-awareness middleware to support processing of context values. While this layered architecture is very natural for the design and implementation of applications, it gives rise to new kinds of faults and faulty behavior modes, which are difficult to detect using existing validation techniques. In this paper we provide scenarios illustrating such faults and exploring how they manifest in context-aware adaptive applications.","M Sama, DS Rosenblum, Z Wang, S Elbaum ",Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Software Architectures and Mobility,Conference Paper,2008,Query,yes,yes,yes,,,,,,x,,,,It is a position paper so be careful in the data extraction
76,"SAC: semantic adaptive caching for spatial mobile applications
","Mobile location-based applications rely heavily on network connections. When the mobile devices are offline, such applications become less accessible to users. A cache-based method is proposed to improve the offline accessibility for mobile location-based applications. The central idea is that when users are browsing information, the client program not only submits the current query window to the server, but also attempts to predict the most likely (from a probabilistic standpoint) query windows that would be submitted to the server in the future. The major challenge is the very large number of possible future query windows. This challenge is tackled by proposing a discretization technique that makes predictions over a finite subset of all possible query windows. A probabilistic model is proposed for prediction, which is trained using the query log recorded by the client, so that the prediction can be executed entirely on the client side. The advantage of this technique is that it requires no modification on the existing server side, so it can be adapted by most existing applications easily. The usability of the technique is demonstrated by prototyping it on top the NewsStand system so that the query window is constantly changing as users pan and zoom around the world using a gesturing interface, among others. Evaluation shows the prototype to be effective while decreasing the response time.","C Liu, BC Fruin, H Samet ",Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,Conference Paper,2013,Query,yes,yes,yes,x,,,,,,,,,

79,A lightweight adaptive compression scheme for energy-efficient mobile-to-mobile file sharing applications,"We propose an energy efficient adaptive scheme for mobile-to-mobile file sharing applications. The proposed scheme monitors the signal strength level during the file transfer process and compresses data blocks on-the-fly only whenever energy reduction gain is expected. The proposed scheme exploits the trade-off between spending energy to compress a file and transmit less data versus spending energy sending the file uncompressed and, thus, without additional computations before transmission. By applying data compression, the intended information is sent with lower number of bits and, thus, less transmission energy. However, the computational as well as memory access requirements of compression algorithms could consume more energy than simply transmitting data uncompressed. Moreover, if the transmission rate over the wireless medium is high then the need for compression might be reduced or even eliminated as data is transferred efficiently within a limited amount of time. We evaluate and optimize the performance of the proposed adaptive compression scheme using experimental measurements in different scenarios and as a function of various parameters. Energy consumption results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves notable energy reduction gains when compared to other traditional approaches. Moreover, we derive an empirical energy model that analytically quantifies the energy consumed during data transmission as a function of the signal strength level and during data compression as a function of the data size. The derived empirical model is then used to obtain energy consumption results for file sharing over multihop scenarios."," Sharafeddine, R Maddah ","Journal of Network and Computer Applications

This paper considers such a system model and presents a cross-layer approach to jointly design adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) at the physical layer and cooperative truncated automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol at the data link layer. We first derive a closed form expression for the spectral efficiency of the joint cooperative ARQ-AMC scheme. Aiming at maximizing this performance measure, we then optimize two AMC schemes for S-D and R-D links, which directly satisfy a prescribed packet loss rate constraint. As an interesting application, we also consider the problem of joint link adaptation and blockage mitigation in land mobile satellite communications (LMSC). We also present a new relay-assisted transmission protocol for LMSC, which delivers the source data to the destination via the relaying link, when the S-D channel is in outage. Numerical results indicate that the proposed schemes noticeably enhances the spectral efficiency compared to a system, which uses a conventional ARQ-AMC scheme at the S-D link, or a system which employs an optimized fixed rate cooperative-ARQ protocol.","M Mardani, JS Harsini, F Lahouti, B Eliasi ","Submitted to the International Journal on Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, Wiley & Sons, Submitted July 2008",Journal Article,2008,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,

This creates a need for researchers to develop effective and efficient malware classification and detection approaches. To address this need, we introduce DroidClassifier: a systematic framework for classifying network traffic generated by mobile malware. Our approach utilizes network traffic analysis to construct multiple models in an automated fashion using a supervised method over a set of labeled malware network traffic (the training dataset). Each model is built by extracting common identifiers from multiple HTTP header fields. Adaptive thresholds are designed to capture the disparate characteristics of different malware families. Clustering is then used to improve the classification efficiency. Finally, we aggregate the multiple models to construct a holistic model to conduct cluster-level malware classification. We then perform a comprehensive evaluation of DroidClassifier by using 706 malware samples as the training set and 657 malware samples and 5,215 benign apps as the testing set. Collectively, these malicious and benign apps generate 17,949 network flows. The results show that DroidClassifier successfully identifies over 90% of different families of malware with more than 90% accuracy with accessible computational cost. Thus, DroidClassifier can facilitate network management in a large network, and enable unobtrusive detection of mobile malware. By focusing on analyzing network behaviors, we expect DroidClassifier to work with reasonable accuracy for other mobile platforms such as iOS and Windows Mobile as well.","Z Li, L Sun, Q Yan, W Srisa-an, Z Chen ","International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Systems

","Mobile cloud computing provides powerful computing and storage capacity on managing GPS big data by offloading vast workloads to remote clouds. For the mobile applications with urgent computing or communication deadline, it is necessary to reduce the workload transmission latency between mobile devices and clouds. This can be technically achieved by expanding mobile cloudlets that are moving co-located with Access Points (APs). However, it is not-trivial to place such movable cloudlets efficiently to enhance the cloud service for dynamic context-aware mobile applications.

The objective of the proposed scheme is two-fold: to speedup data access and to mitigate the performance bottleneck at WMN gateways. In our proposed adaptive scheme, a data object can be cached at the mesh client (MC) directly or at a mesh router (MR) dynamically selected by APPCCM, such that the overall network cost incurred for the WMN to process the MC's mobility and data access/update events is minimized. APPCCM is adaptive, per-user and per-object as the decision of where to cache a data object accessed by an MC depends on the MC's mobility and object access/update characteristics, and the WMN conditions. We demonstrate via model-based analysis that APPCCM outperforms non-adaptive schemes that always cache a data object at the MC, or at the MC's current serving MR for cache consistency management in WMNs.","Y Li, R Chen",Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE 35th Conference on Local Computer Networks,Conference Paper,2010,Query,yes,yes,no,,x,,,,,,,,

","The improvement in hardware capabilities of mobile devices has led to the active use of processor-heavy contents, such as multimedia files, on resource-limited platforms. In addition to simply enjoying such contents on mobile devices, recently commercialized protocols allow the real-time sharing of multimedia (or a mobile device's screen contents) with neighboring devices via wireless connection. However, unlike PC-scale computing platforms, use-case expansions on mobile devices face an additional technical challenge. Specifically, while the improved computation power is capable of handling processor-hungry applications, battery limitations hold back their full utilization. This paper acknowledges the fact that screen sharing on mobile devices can be attractive, but empirically show that minimizing the energy consumption is crutial, and introduces enhancements to the widely used H.264 encoder on mobile devices. Specifically, our enhancements target to minimize the transmission size of multimedia contents by analyzing the screen's dynamics. For contents with high dynamics, our scheme tries to maintain the video quality, while aggressively skipping frames for regions with minimal motion intensity. Our empirical evaluations show that the proposed light-weight enhancements reduce the size of a typical multimedia file by 42%, while maintaining a high user-perceived quality (e.g., Structural SIMilarity measure) of 0.925. Wirelessly sharing this video results in 31% lower frame transmission rate and up to 21% power savings in less dynamic regions.","KW Lim, J Ha, P Bae, J Ko, YB Ko "," IEEE Systems Journal, 2016",Journal Article,2016,Query,yes,yes,yes,x,,,,,,,,,

However, implementing cloud offloading techniques remains a delicate and complex task, reserved for expert programmers. If cloud computing is to realize its promise as a generally applicable, powerful optimization technique for mobile applications, its implementation barrier must be lowered. As we have discovered, reusable system building blocks exposed via a convenient programming model can facilitate the implementation of complex cloud offloading optimizations. This paper describes a system architecture for implementing adaptive cloud offloading optimizations. In particular, the architecture features parameterizable building blocks for monitoring and estimating energy consumption and performance efficiency as well as state synchronization across address spaces, which the mobile programmer can use a la carte. These blocks streamline the implementation procedure for a wide array of adaptive offloading optimizations.

In the second configuration, mobile devices are considered to be grid resources. However, the interaction between mobile devices and wired networks still has to overcome several difficulties before it can produce an operational mobile grid infrastructure, in either type of configuration. Examples of these challenges include the submission of distributed applications to execute tasks in a coordinated manner, frequent disconnections, restrictions on power consumption and the selection of suitable grid resources for application executions. In this paper, a research study is conducted involving an adaptive fault tolerance approach for grid interfaces in wireless networks to enhance the submission and execution of distributed applications. The approach examines submission, monitoring and management functions through the use of fault tolerance and workflow mechanisms, especially when disconnections occur and the mobile devices are executing an application.

However, assuring that the adaptation goals are satisfied poses complex challenges. We recently developed the ActivFORMS approach that aims to tackle some of these challenges, but further research is required to evaluate the approach. This paper presents the results of a study in which we applied ActivFORMS to a mobile storytelling application that employs a social recommender. The initial version of the application used a static recommender that could not deal with changing environment conditions, or take into account preferences of users. To that end, we added a self-adaptive layer on top of the application. The study results show that self-adaptation significantly increases the quality of recommendations compared to the initial version by: (1) enabling the social recommender to adapt to the quality of user input and unavailability of the GPS service, and (2) making the recommender adaptive to user preferences. Providing guarantees for these adaptation goals is crucial in this domain from a business perspective. The study results show the feasibility and effectiveness of ActivFORMS for a practical application, but they also underpin the need for an integrated verification approach for self-adaptive systems that combines offline with online verification.","D Weyns, S Shevtsov, S Pllana",IEEE Eighth International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems,Conference Paper,2014,Query,yes,yes,no,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,,

111,Enabling Adaptive Context Views for Mobile Applications : Negotiating Global and Dynamic Sensor Information,"Mobile devices with Internet access and large amounts of sensors, pushes the development of intelligent services towards new forms of pervasive applications. These applications are made context-aware by utilizing information from sensors and hence the context of a situation, in order to provide a better service. Based on this, the focus of this thesis is on the challenge of creating context awareness in mobile applications. That both utilizes dynamic context information from globally available sensors and provides adaptive views of relevant context information to applications.

The first challenge is to identify the properties of an architecture that provides scalable access to information from global sensors within bounded time, because existing systems do not support these properties in a satisfactory manner. The majority of related systems employ a centralized approach with limited support for global sensor information due to poor scalability. Therefore, this thesis proposes a distributed architecture capable of exchanging context between users and entities on a peer-to-peer overlay. Pervasive applications can thus utilize global sensor information in a scalable and manageable way within predictable time bounds.

The second challenge to support continually changing and evolving context information, while providing it as both adaptive and manageable views to applications. To address this particular problem, this thesis proposes the usage of a locally stored evolving context object called a context schema. In detail, this schema contains all context information that is considered as being relevant for a specific user or entity. Furthermore, this thesis proposes an application interface that can provide snapshots of the evolving context schemas as adaptive views. These views can then be used in context-aware mobile applications, without inducing unnecessary delays.

By successfully addressing the challenges, this thesis enables the creation of pervasive and adaptive applications that utilize evolving context in mobile environments. These capabilities are made possible by enabling access to global sensor information based on a distributed context exchange overlay, in combination with evolving context schemas offered as views through an application interface. In support of these claims, this thesis has developed numerous proof-of-concept applications and prototypes to verify the approach. Hence, this thesis concludes that the proposed approach with evolving context information has the ability to scale in a satisfactory manner and also has the ability to dynamically offer relevant views to applications in a manageable way.",S Forsström ,diva-portal.org ,"Research Article

","Mobile augmented reality applications rely on automatically matching a captured visual scene to an image in a database. This is typically achieved by deriving a set of features for the captured image, transmitting them through a network and then matching with features derived for a database of reference images. A fundamental problem is to select as few and robust features as possible such that the matching accuracy is invariant to distortions caused by camera capture whilst minimising the bit rate required for their transmission. In this paper, novel feature selection methods are proposed, based on the entropy of the image content, entropy of extracted features and the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) coefficients. The methods proposed in the descriptor domain and DCT domain achieve better matching accuracy under low bit rate transmission than start-of-the-art peak based feature selection used within the MPEG-7 Compact Descriptor for Visual Search (CDVS). This is verified from image retrieval experiments and results for a realistic dataset with complex real world capturing distortion. Results show that the proposed method can improve the matching accuracy for various detectors and also indicate that the feature selection can not only achieves low bit rate transmission but also results in a higher matching accuracy than using all features when applied to distorted images. Hence, even if all the features can be transmitted in high transmission bandwidth scenarios, feature selection should still be applied to the distorted query image to ensure high matching accuracy.","Y Cao, C Ritz, R Raad ",8th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS),Conference Paper,2014,Query,yes,yes,yes,x,,,,,,,,,

The significant features of terminal sliding mode control method are robustness and finite time convergence, but the robustness is related to the large switching control gain which is determined by uncertain issues and can lead to chattering phenomena. Neural networks can reduce the chattering and approximate nonlinear issues. In this work, a novel B-spline curve-based B-spline neural network (BSNN) is developed.

In addition, the variety of services in Internet or Intranet, such as Web services, UPnP services, Jini services and so on, will also increase the difficulty in using them. Thus, when developing a mobile application to access these services, developers are forced to expose to these problems and therefore it will spend much time writing a mobile application.

However, monolithic systems have been shown to be inefficient and unscalable. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a system consisting of multiple adaptive applications, and adaptive MAC and transport layers. We evaluate this system by implementing an adaptive video encoding application, showing that a layered approach sharing enough information can enable energy efficiency while maintaining sufficient isolation to allow the replacement of components without requiring a whole-system redesign.","AF Harris, R Snader, R Kravets","International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks",Conference Paper,2008,Query,yes,yes,yes,x,,,,,,,,,

124,"An Optimization of Context Sharing for Self-adaptive Mobile Applications
","Because of the high potential of mobile and pervasive computing systems, there is an ongoing trend in developing applications exhibiting context awareness and adaptive behavior. While context awareness guarantees that the applications are aware of both their context and their own state, dynamic adaptivity enables them to react on their knowledge about it and optimize their offered services. However, because in pervasive computing environments there is also a need for enabling arbitrary synergies, such a behavior also requires appropriate algorithms implementing the adaptation logic required to reason on the sensed context and dynamically decide on the most appropriate adaptations. This paper discusses how utility function-based approaches can use context-awareness for that and, additionally, it shows how the decision-making process is improved with respect to both performance and resource consumption by using a more intelligent approach.","N Paspallis, GA Papadopoulos ",Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing,Conference Paper,2008,Query,yes,yes,yes,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,,

","Application identification is beneficial for malware detection, content cache, application-specific QoS, traffic control, etc. The existing identification methods using machine learning are usually limited to identification of protocols, not applications, and hard to adapt to the emergence of new applications. We have been proposing a new method for adaptive application identification with machine learning where we create training dataset in real-time by tagging traffic with application process names from a small number of modified smartphones and identify the unknown flow using the classifier trained by the training data. Our previous research [1] achieves more than 80% of accuracy in application identification when not using DPI (Deep Packet Inspection). In this paper, we propose an extension to the previous method using DPI and on-line machine learning with pre-classification of traffic based on ports to improve the inference accuracy. The evaluation shows that our method can identify more than 92% of traffic accurately using DPI when learning period is 5 days, and achieves up to 93% of accuracy at best for general traffic. When limited to HTTP, the accuracy becomes 96%. This result shows that we can build a system identifying more than 92% of the applications adaptively in relatively short training period, e.g., 5 days of training, even when new applications emerge. We envision that our proposed system eventually enables application specific traffic engineering as well as application specific network function execution within the network.","T Iwai, A Nakao",18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS),Conference Paper,2016,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,

129,An adaptive computation offloading decision for energy-efficient execution of mobile applications in clouds,"In recent years, computation offloading, through which applications on a mobile device can offload their computations onto more resource-rich clouds, has emerged as a promising technique to reduce battery consumption as well as augment the devices' limited computation and memory capabilities. In order for computation offloading to be energy-efficient, an accurate estimate of battery consumption is required to decide between local processing and computation offloading. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for estimating battery consumption without requiring detailed information about the mobile application's internal structure or its execution behavior. In our approach, the relationship is derived between variables that affect battery consumption (i.e., the input to the application, the transmitted data, and resource status) and the actual consumed energy from the application's past run history. We evaluated the performance of the proposed technique using two different types of mobile applications over different wireless network environments such as 3G, Wi-Fi, and LTE. The experimental results show that our technique can provide tolerable estimation accuracy and thus make correct decisions between local processing and computation offloading.","BD Lee, KH Lim, YH Choi, N Kim",IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems,Journal Article,2014,Query,yes,yes,yes,x,,,,,,,,,

131,CloudAware: Empowering context‐aware self‐adaptation for mobile applications,"Mobile devices are already woven into our everyday life, and we became accustomed that mobile applications assist us in a multitude of daily activities. With the rise of the Internet of Things, new opportunities to further automatize tedious tasks open up. New functional and user experience requirements demand for further resources and new ways to acquire these, because mobile devices remain comparatively limited in terms of, eg, computation, storage, and battery life. To face these challenges, current approaches augment mobile applications either with cloud resources (mobile cloud computing) or with resources near the mobile device at the logical edge of the network (mobile edge computing) onto which tasks can be offloaded during runtime. However, this does not automatically solve the conflict between resource demands and good user experience, as current solutions prove. It is the dynamically changing context that makes for good or bad offloading strategies. In this paper, we corroborate this finding by first evaluating 40 existing solutions based on a requirements catalogue derived from several application scenarios as well as the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission criteria for software quality. Afterward, we present CloudAware, which is a mobile cloud computing/mobile edge computing middleware that supports automated context-aware self-adaptation techniques that ease the development of elastic, scalable, and context-adaptive mobile applications. Moreover, we present a qualitative evaluation of our concepts and quantitatively evaluate different offloading scenarios using real usage data to prove that mobile applications indeed benefit from context-aware self-adaptation techniques. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open challenges.","G Orsini, D Bade, W Lamersdorf ",Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies,Journal Article,2018,Query,yes,yes,no,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,pass,,
132,Transparent and adaptive application partitioning using mobile objects,"The dynamic nature and heterogeneity of modern execution environments such as mobile, ubiquitous, and grid computing, present major challenges for the development and efficient execution of the applications targeted for these environments. In particular, applications tailored to run in a specific environment will show different and most likely sub-optimal behaviour when executed on a different and/or dynamic environment. Consequently, there has been growing interests in the area of application adaptation which aims to enable applications to cope with the varying execution environments.

Adaptive application partitioning, a specific form of non-functional adaptation involving distribution of mobile objects across multiple host machines, is of particular interest to this thesis due to the diversity of its uses. In this approach, certain runtime information (known as context) is used to allow an object-oriented application to adaptively (re)adjust the placement of its objects during its execution, for purposes such as improving application performance and reliability as well as balancing resource utilisation across machines. Promoting the adoption of such adaptation requires a process that requires minimal human involvement in both the execution and the development of the relevant application. These challenges establish the main goals and contributions of this work, which include:

1) Proposing an effective application partitioning solution via the adoption of a decentralised adaptation strategy known as local adaptation.
2) Enabling adaptive application partitioning which does not require human intervention, through automatic collection of required information/context.
3) Proposing a solution for transparently injecting the required adaptation functionality into regular object-oriented applications allowing significant reduction of the associated development cost/effort.

The proposed solutions have been implemented in a Java-based adaptation framework called MobJeX.

136,Adaptive mobile gis and applications,"In the context of the mobile Internet and wireless devices, the openness, extensibility and flexibility of spatial data models used in applications are important in terms of maps on demand, data storage, data transfer and data processing. Hence the provision of an open, extendable and flexible spatial data model should, in all likelihood, substantially enhance the performance of mobile device spatial data transmission and display. The research presented in this thesis aims to develop an adaptive mobile Geographical Information Systems (GIS) framework, designed to address the following important issues: (a) portability and sharing of geospatial data; (b) intelligent processing of geospatial data; and (c) performance of geospatial data transmission. The adaptive mobile GIS framework is based on a three-tier client/server architecture and consists of a client application tier, middleware tier and data management tier. The client tier mainly handles effective and efficient presentation of spatial information to the users. The middleware tier supports adaptation in terms of personalization, security, and all geospatial information tasks such as map content request and complex spatial query. The data management tier is responsible for storing and accessing spatial information, using an open source standard relational database management system (RDBMS), which implements spatial extensions and follows the specification of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The prime objective of this research is to derive an optimized mobile spatial data model with high adaptability as regards the representation and processing of geo-referenced map images and associated attributes for adaptive mobile GIS frameworks. It is intended to be an efficient mechanism for provisioning mobile GIS applications. An efficient spatial data transferring algorithm for delivering spatial data, named by the author, Adaptive Base Block of Object Transmission (ABBOT), has been developed and refined for various existing connecting environments. A highly efficient indexing scheme, Geo-Planar Indexing (GPI), has been derived for fast retrieval of geospatial data under the standard RDBMS environment without using expensive R-Tree spatial access methods in mobile working environments. Extensive experiments have been conducted to test the efficiency and usability of the three component tiers of the adaptive mobile GIS framework. The successful testing of a series of complex mobile device spatial analysis queries concluded that the proposed adaptive mobile GIS framework is viable for designing and developing a full functional mobile GIS with good performance in spatial data handling and complex spatial query operation.",GYK Shea,Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Hong Kong),PhD Thesis,2011,Query,no,no,no,,,,,,,x,,,

Existing mobile ofﬂoading solutions generally rely on full virtual machine migration, which is coarse-grained and costly, or implementation of code ofﬂoading as part of the application logic, which greatly increases the application complexity and the associated software development costs. Some recent solutions implement ﬁne-grained ofﬂoading, but pause the local mobile application while waiting for the ofﬂoaded code results. This leads to sequential execution and wastes local mobile resources and ignores the potential elasticity of the cloud environment. We have developed the IMCM framework to support parallel mobile application ofﬂoading to multiple cloud spaces. IMCM is ﬁnegrained, supporting application distribution at the granularity of individual components; it is adaptive, addressing the dynamicity in run-time conditions and end-user contexts; and it is fully parallel, supporting both parallel application model and simultaneous execution at mobile device and multiple private and public cloud spaces.

","English language learners (ELL) have dedicated considerable time and effort to the development of their language proficiency. This has included the use of a variety of mobile assisted language learning (MALL) tools that are either unproven or that have undergone limited evaluations of their effectiveness. The majority of these evaluations have been performed with beginner foreign-language learners at the post-secondary level. Moreover, dedicated MALL tools rarely support the learner’s ability to communicate in English. I propose and demonstrate the feasibility of an adaptive MALL approach that aims to scaffold ELL vocabulary and communication needs. This scaffolding recommends learning materials to ELLs by employing the ecological approach to dynamically reason over logs of learner interactions with a MALL tool. The highly personalized approach to supporting learners that is operationalized through this tool was developed following user-centered design principles. The development of the learning content generation and recommendation mechanisms that are included as part of this approach to supporting English language learners was validated through two studies. An additional exploratory evaluation of this adaptive approach to supporting ELL communication and learning activities was performed before evaluating its influence on ELL vocabulary knowledge, communication, and affect through two studies. These studies considered the effectiveness of the proposed MALL approach from multiple perspectives. The first took place in a Japanese high school and focused on the relationship between student vocabulary knowledge and system usage. The second involved advanced English language learners and took place in the greater Toronto area. This study aimed to determine the relationships among system usage, user communicative success, and user affect. The work presented in this thesis shows that the use of the proposed approach can support ELL communication, vocabulary development, and affect. The evaluation of this approach allowed the creation of models that predict learning outcomes based on learners’ MALL usage and knowledge. Combining the results of these studies with those of the formative evaluations, indicates that a mobile tool that employs the ecological approach to learner modeling can support the learning activities, vocabulary learning outcomes, affect, and communication of English language learners.",C Demmans Epp ,University of Toronto,PhD Thesis,2016,Query,,,,,,,,,,x,,,

The latter, refers to the ability of systems to adapt themselves and their environment by means of adapting their own operation, or instructing changes in other devices they control (e.g. actuators embedded in the environment). Evidently, a critical requirement for facing and tackling these challenges is to glue the sensing and shaping parts together, by means of appropriate algorithms for reasoning on the environment situation and deciding on the appropriate adaptations.

","Current mobile devices such as mobile phones and PDAs are able to run applications that can demand a considerable storage space. When these devices run out of local memory, they require backing up their files in an external storage device, which could restrict the user mobility. This paper presents an Adaptive File Transfer Middleware (AFTM) for mobile applications. This middleware eases the transfer of files between a mobile device and an external storage server by accessing the best wireless connection (WiFi, GPRS/UMTS) available, considering quality and cost of the service. AFTM is also able to use the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) as another option for transferring files. A File Backup Service (FBS) was built on top of the AFTM. The FBS will detect when the device ran out of local memory and will automatically send selected files from the mobile device to an external storage server, freeing the mobile storage memory. To decide which files should be backed up, FBS implements several file replacement policies. Results showed that the selection of one replacement policy will be a trade-off between the efficiency of the algorithm and the cost of the wireless service available when a file needs to be backed up.",Mario A.

","Process industry workplaces are increasingly more automated and require workers to collaborate with an automated agent. Implementing mobile devices in such workplaces is expected to improve task performance and restore multi-sensory cues by providing information to workers at the point of work. Focus group was conducted with 23 field workers to identify challenges that they currently face and proposed opportunities to address them. This resulted in identifying 19 challenges and 7 opportunities to address them using mobile devices. I designed one opportunity that used Adaptive Automation to deliver location-specific equipment operational data to workers at the point of work. Usability results from four participants validated the application and earned an excellent mean System Usability Scale score of 85. The design is expected to provide workers with real-time and projected operational data using a mobile device, providing smart services and allowing them to deliver more accurate equipment diagnosis during maintenance work.",N Addnan,University of Toronto,Masters Thesis,2016,Query,no,no,no,,,,,,,x,,,

152,"A New Lattice LP-Based Post-Filter for Adaptive Noise Cancellers in Mobile and Vehicular Applications
","Adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) is a well-known technique for background noise reduction in automobile and vehicular environments. The noise fields in automobile and other vehicle interior obey the diffuse noise field model closely. On the other hand, the ANC does not provide sufficient noise reduction in the diffuse noise fields. In this paper, a new multistage post-filter is designed for ANC as a solution to diffuse noise conditions. The designed post-filter is a single channel linear prediction (LP) based speech enhancement system. The LP is performed by an adaptive lattice filter and attempts to extract speech components by using intermediate ANC signals. The post-filter has no processing delay which is suitable for speech communication systems. We have evaluated the performance of proposed system in various real-life noise fields, recorded in an automobile environment. The experimental results using various quality measures show that the proposed method is superior to both the adaptive noise canceller and LP-based speech enhancement systems.",Soheil Khorram ; Hossein Sameti ; Hadi Veisi ; Hamid Reza Abutalebi,IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology,Conference Paper,2008,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,

The hysteresis friction nonlinearity from the pivot bearing degrades the servo performance, as hard disk drive servo system operates in track-following mode. To deal with the eﬀect of hysteresis friction nonlinearity, adaptive hysteresis friction compensation with RBFNN approximation is proposed.

The end users of such applications thus suffer significant energy issues. In this paper, we propose CrowdAdaptor, a novel approach toward locating energy-efficient configurations to execute the applications hosted in virtual machines on handheld devices. CrowdAdaptor innovatively makes use of the development artifacts (test cases) and the very large installation base of the same application to distribute the test executions and performance data collection of the whole test suites against many different virtual machine configurations among these installation bases. It synthesizes these data, continuously discovers better energy-efficient configurations, and makes them available to all the installations of the same applications. We report a multi-subject case study on the ability of the framework to discover energy-efficient configurations in three power models. The results show that Crowd Adaptor can achieve up to 50% of energy savings based on a conservative linear power model.",Edward Y.Y. Kan ; W.K. Chan ; T.H.

The controlling of picture quality by modifying the quantization parameter (QP) is most widely used. In this paper, we demonstrate that reducing the spatial resolution adaptively can be more efficient in terms of picture quality and energy consumption in low bit-rate environment, and present a model to find the optimal spatial resolution for the available bandwidth. Adaptive spatial resolution control scheme is especially effective when the bandwidth between the video server and the mobile device varies considerably with time, and when the mobile device is sensitive to energy consumption. Our scheme can improve the picture quality by approximately O.5dB and reduce energy consumption by more than 50% compared to the conventional video coding in low bit-rate environment.","Lee, Hee-Jung; Lee, Yong-Hee; Lee, Jong-Hun; Shin, Heon-Shik;",The Journal of Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences,Journal,2009,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,

The effectiveness of learning which was provided by adaptive and personalized visualization of mobile learning can be accomplish by adjusting appropriate brightness in various lighting conditions. The aims of this research is to collect two kinds of data, the first one is sensor data value (lux) as the environment brightness and another one is screen brightness (luminance) in mobile devices. In this paper, we developed an Android application program to collect these data. By collecting these data, appropriate brightness will be arrange to create a screen viewability and comfort to support mobile learning activities. As the result of testing with various conditions, surrounding brightness data in dim condition is 30 lux - 40 lux, which is the appropriate screen brightness is 25 cd/m2 - 35 cd/m2. The maximum surrounding brightness data is 10.000 lux in outdoor with sun daylight and maximum screen brightness is 255 cd/m2. As the conclusion, collecting data in various light conditions gives us basic data for adaptive screen optimization in mobile learning. Further, these data can be analysed and useful for adaptive visualization in mobile learning application.","Muladi, Fitri Shofiana, Yasuhisa Okazaki","International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Informatics, and Its Education",Conference,2015,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,

Although many of such mobile collaboration applications potentially share a good amount of functionality, most of them are developed from scratch, monolithic and tailored to specific mobile platforms, what limits their applicability. This chapter presents a client middleware architecture which supports dynamic deployment and composition of components for context-awareness, common collaboration services, and presents a context oriented language easing the coding of such applications. We also present some prototype context-aware applications implemented on the top of our middleware services, one of which was used to assess the advantages of using our middleware.","David L., Viterbo J., Malcher M., Fonseca H., Baptista G., Endler M",Mobile Context Awareness,Chapter in a Book,2012,Query,,,,,,,,,,x,,,
165,A proactive approach for context-aware self-adaptive mobile applications to ensure Quality of Service,"Mobile Applications are rapidly emerging as a convenient medium for using a variety of services. With the high penetration of smart phones in society, self-adaptation has become an essential capability required by mobile application users. In an ideal scenario, an application is required to adjust its behavior according to the current context of its use. This raises the challenge in mobile computing towards the design and development of applications that sense and react to contextual changes to provide a value-added user experience. In its general sense, context information can relate to the environment, the user, or the device status. In this paper, a framework is proposed for building context aware and adaptive mobile applications. Based on the concepts of software requirement specification and probabilistic modeling, this framework guides the modeling of adaptability at design time and supports context awareness and adaptability at runtime to tackle potential issues that can hamper Quality of Service (QoS). In the core of the approach, a probabilistic model has been derived from the software requirement model using the quantitative terms of context dependability and then, it is continuously verified against the runtime operations of a mobile application. Finally, the proposed approach has been used in a mobile application development use case to observe how proactive adaptability can be built into mobile application development to ensure QoS.",Md.

166,Effect of an adaptive career-consultation mobile application on students' competency development,"Graduate youth unemployment has recently substantially increased, and the learning-application gap is a major problem. Universities are crucial for addressing this gap. An adaptive career-consultation mobile application (ACCMA) integrating student capabilities and interests was developed to help students connect what they are learning at university with workplace needs. With a questionnaire, 475 senior university students were surveyed. The ACCMA was significantly more beneficial than general career counselling at assisting students in understanding their capabilities and interests and planning their future careers. Additionally, students were more satisfied with this method of career consultation. It is suggested that the learning-application gap can be reduced by using mobile technology to provide students with information and by assessing students' capabilities and interests, and how they may fit in the current employment market. This will enhance their employability and competitiveness and reinforce their future career development.","Po-Han Wu, Yu-Hsien Huang",International Journal of Mobile Learning and Organisation,Journal,2017,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,
167,ADAPTIVE MOBILE APPLICATIONS,"The area of computing incorporates a vast range of devices with different capabilities in terms of battery life, network connectivity, processing power and disk management. An endless battery life and flawless connectivity to multiple wireless access points are increasingly essential for the mobile device user. Nevertheless the battery life and the capability of being able to connect to wireless networks will fluctuate greatly between each device. Portable multimedia devices such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDA’s) and Smartphones with restricted memory will also vary greatly; however, users of these devices will expect optimal multimedia delivery. Therefore we need an intelligent middleware application that will take a critical role for the coordination between the devices hardware and software so that the user can get the full potential from the device. We document the development of an intelligent media player application which can adapt to platform state changes using the Intel Mobile SDK. The application can detect and respond appropriately to changes in network connectivity, network connection quality and power consumption optimization and then gracefully handle intermittent connectivity.","Conrad Deighan*, Joan Condell and Kevin Curran",Mobile Computing Research and Applications,Chapter in a Book,2009,Query,no,no,no,,,,,,,x,,,

However, adaptation requires an up-to-the-minute understanding of the state of the environment, which often comes with a significant added cost in terms of computation and communication. In this paper, we explore possibilities for measuring the degree of mobility in dynamic ubiquitous networks. Existing measures of mobility degree are either global values (e.g., the average node speed) or local measures that require additional coordination (e.g., the relative speed of neighboring nodes). In contrast, we describe a completely passive approach to measuring the local mobility degree that uses knowledge about communication mechanisms to determine the network dynamics affecting a single node. This context information can subsequently be used by a node to adapt communication and application protocols to current conditions. In this paper, we define a passive metric that gives a node an approximate view of local network dynamics and compare its ability to capture dynamics with existing metrics.","Sumit Kumar Sar, Dinesh Kumar Bhawnani, Chaitali Choudhary","International Journal of Advanced in Management, Technology and Engineering Sciences",Journal,2018,Query,yes,yes,no,,x,,,,,,,,
169,A fog computing based concept drift adaptive process mining framework for mobile APPs,"Mobile applications are widely used to provide users convenient and friendly service experiences. Meanwhile, service logs generated by mobile applications are analyzed to obtain user behavior patterns for monitoring and optimizing mobile application performances. However, due to the frequent updates in mobile application, situations of concept drifts often occur in service log streams, which lead to challenges in mobile process mining. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to solve the above problems by combining fog-computing-based concept drift detecting with cloud-computing-based process mining. Firstly, incomplete log data are preprocessed using fog-computing technologies to provide more accurate log contexts and lower overhead. Then, concept drift detecting methods are used in cloud computing layer to deal with the transfer of mobile applications from one version to another. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our framework can deduce missed case identifiers for logs when concept drifts happen.","TaoHuanga, BoyiXub, Hongming Cai, Jiawei Du, Kuo-Ming Chao, Chengxi Huanga, ","Future Generation Computer Systems

185,Content-Adaptive Display Power Saving for Internet Video Applications on Mobile Devices,"Backlight scaling is a technique proposed to reduce the display panel power consumption by strategically dimming the backlight. However, for mobile video applications, a computationally intensive luminance compensation step must be performed in combination with backlight scaling to maintain the perceived appearance of video frames. This step, if done by the Central Processing Unit (CPU), could easily offset the power savings via backlight dimming. Furthermore, computing the backlight scaling values requires per-frame luminance information, which is typically too energy intensive to compute on mobile devices. In this article, we propose Content-Adaptive Display (CAD) for two typical Internet mobile video applications: video streaming and real-time video communication. CAD uses the mobile device’s Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) rather than the CPU to perform luminance compensation at reduced power consumption. For video streaming where video frames are available in advance, we compute the backlight scaling schedule using a more efficient dynamic programming algorithm than existing work. For real-time video communication where video frames are generated on the fly, we propose a greedy algorithm to determine the backlight scaling at runtime. We implement CAD in one video streaming application and one real-time video call application on the Android platform and use a Monsoon power meter to measure the real power consumption. Experiment results show that CAD can save more than 10% overall power consumption for up to 55.7% videos during video streaming and up to 31.0% overall power consumption in real-time video calls.","Yao Liu, Mengbai Xiao, Ming Zhang, Xin Li, Mian Dong, Zhan Ma, Zhenhua Li, Lei Guo, Songqing Chen","ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications",Journal,2016,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,

However, the rapid growth of mobile devices has made it a challenge for the remote cloud to provide computing and storage capacities with low communication delays due to the fact that the remote cloud is geographically far away from mobile devices. Reducing the completion time of applications in mobile devices through the technical expending mobile cloudlets which are moving collocated with Access Points (APs) is necessary. To address the above issues, this paper proposes EACP-CA (Enhanced Adaptive Cloudlets Placement approach based on Covering Algorithm), an enhanced adaptive cloudlet placement approach for mobile applications in a given network area. We apply the CA (Covering Algorithm) to adaptively cluster the mobile devices based on their geographical locations, the aggregation regions of the mobile devices are identified, and the cloudlet destination locations are also confirmed according to the clustering centers. In addition, we can also obtain the traces between the original and destination locations of these mobile cloudlets. To increase the efficiency, we parallelize CA on Spark. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing approach in both effectiveness and efficiency.","Yiwen Zhang, Kaibin Wang, Yuanyuan Zhou, and Qiang He2",Security and Communication Networks,Article,2018,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,

A robust adap-tive controller is proposed using fuzzy logic. The possible singularity problem met in the feedback linearization is avoided by introducing the regular inverse of the estimated control gain matrix. The algebraic loop problem encountered in the implementation of the proposed controller, which is caused by compensating the additional term due to the use of the regular inverse, is circumvented by employing filtered signals, and the approximation errors and external disturbances can be efficiently counteracted by employing robust compensators. All signals in the resulting closed-loop can be guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. The proposed control scheme does not require a priori knowledge of the plant dynamics. Simulation results through the tracking control of a nonholonomic mobile robot with plant uncertainties and external disturbances show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

191,Enabling Mobile Adaptive Computing Environment in Teleteaching and Telemidecine Applications,"The concept of medical treatment from a distance (in absentia care) is actually quite ancient, dating back to tribal days where smoke signals were used to warn of serious disease in a community. Nowadays, telemedicine is used to facilitate treatment in rural areas, where the nearest doctor is miles away, through various forms of information technology, including videoconferencing and digital imaging. It can also be used to conveniently monitor chronically ill patients through electronic devices so that they can enjoy a better quality of life. But despite the strides that have been made in utilizing the telemedicine technology, there remain a number of limitations and weaknesses that must be overcome before this treatment paradigm can reach its full potential. In Mobile Telemedicine: A Computing and Network Perspective, noted computer scientists Yang Xiao and Hui Chen examine those computing and networking dilemmas arising from wireless and mobile telemedicine. Comprised of the contributions of many prominent international researchers, the book discusses the relative merits and limitations of the existing technology and sheds light on future developments. It begins with a discussion of patient care and monitoring through items such as personal alarm systems. It then reviews the current methods available to monitor cardiac and diabetic patients, analyzes the security and privacy considerations that arise with respect to the transmission of sensitive information, and examines issues relating to networking support. Finally, it concludes with a section on the opportunities and challenges faced by those involved at this intersection of healthcare and communications. By bridging the fields of medicine and information technology, this volume serves as a useful springboard for those pioneering IT researchers looking for a comprehensive reference. The book also provides information for those involved with either communications or healthcare who want to learn about the current state and potential use of this technology.",Tuan Cao-Huu,Mobile Telemedicine: A Computing and Networking Perspective,Chapter in a Book,2008,Query,no,no,no,,,,,,,x,,,

That is, the application presents only the media objects with the conditions evaluated to be true according to the user’s demand or preference. The feature of adapting presentation contents can significantly improve browsing results through providing materials that are more suitable for each individual user. In the mobile environment, some more changing factors can affect a user’s access to the contents generated by the presentation engine. These factors include location, available bandwidth, past visits, the currently closest media source, etc. In this paper, we propose an adaptive content generating engine called Mach for mobility-aware multimedia applications. Mach’s goal is that a single content description file can be applied to compose various multimedia presentations. By following the statements of the description file and the user’s preference, Mach can dynamically generate adaptive contents for each class of users. In this way, the content designer does not need to compose several description files for each class of users. Mach is based on the XML (eXtensible Markup Language) standard and thus its platform independence makes our work well-suited to the mobile environment.",Chian Wang,Human Interface and the Management of Information.

So, there are ofﬂoading schemes which move the computing power and data storage away from a mobile phone into a power full cloud server which has a big storage space by ofﬂoading methods or services to the cloud server. However, the ofﬂoading might consume more energy than the local processing of data when the size of code is small. This paper introduces a new ofﬂoading scheme by using decision making approaches. The scheme considers each service or process in a mobile application as a set of methods and can ofﬂoad a group of methods based on a deﬁned cost model. Also, it enumerates the set of solutions based on decision making approaches to ﬁnd all feasible solutions which satisfy the cost model then it selects the best feasible solution among them.

In the general population, almost 2.15 per 1000 persons will experience some form of ankle joint sprain or injury annually. Although the patients go on to heal without long term consequences in many cases, some may develop chronic ankle instability which is a debilitating condition incorporating recurrent sprains, persistent pain and repeated instances of giving way. Wearable ankle braces or assistive devices are designed to support the injured joint and help the user get back to the normal life style while the joint is healing and recovering its normal function. Although such devices have been shown to be useful, they will bring a lot of other limitations to user's lifestyle by preventing them to pursue occupational or normal day activities due to joint impairment. Lengthy recovery time due to lack of joint's natural activity is an example of such limitations.

In augmented reality applications, fast camera pose estimation and true scale are important. In this paper, we present an adaptive monocular visual–inertial SLAM method for real-time augmented reality applications in mobile devices. First, the SLAM system is implemented based on the visual–inertial odometry method that combines data from a mobile device camera and inertial measurement unit sensor. Second, we present an optical-flow-based fast visual odometry method for real-time camera pose estimation. Finally, an adaptive monocular visual–inertial SLAM is implemented by presenting an adaptive execution module that dynamically selects visual–inertial odometry or optical-flow-based fast visual odometry. Experimental results show that the average translation root-mean-square error of keyframe trajectory is approximately 0.0617 m with the EuRoC dataset. The average tracking time is reduced by 7.8%, 12.9%, and 18.8% when different level-set adaptive policies are applied.

The performance analysis of the proposed hybrid adaptive algorithms is carried out based on the error convergence and correlation coefficient. By taking into consideration of the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithms require small neural training sets and it gives good results. Noise cancellation operation is established through adaptive control with the goal of achieving minimum noise error level at output. This paper focuses on the analysis of noise cancellation using least mean square algorithms, gradient adaptive lattice algorithms, and hybrid adaptive algorithms.

This thesis not only introduces the design and analysis of GoCity, but also discusses four problems in leveraging three concepts—context-awareness, self-adaptation, and usability—in current mobile application design. First, few contexts other than location and time have been used in actual mobile applications. Second, there is no clear classification of context information for mobile application design. Third, mobile application designers lack systematic mechanisms to address sensing and monitoring requirements under changing context situations. This is crucial for effective self-adaptation. Fourth, most mobile applications have low usability due to poor user interface (UI) design. The model proposed in this thesis addresses these issues by (i) supporting diverse context dimensions, (ii) monitoring context changes continuously and tailoring the application behavior according to these changes, and (iii) improving UI design using selected usability methods. In addition, this thesis proposes two classifications of context information for mobile applications: source-based classification—personal context, mobile device context, and environmental context; and property-based classification—static context and dynamic context. The combination of these two classifications helps determine the observed context and its polling rate—the rate at which the context is collected—effectively. A distinctive feature of GoCity is that it supports two interaction modes—static mode and dynamic mode. In static mode, the application generates results only after the user sends the request to it. In other words, it does not actively generate results for users. In contrast, in the dynamic mode, the application continuously updates results even if the user does not send any request to it. The notion of an autonomic element (AE) is used for the dynamic mode to make GoCity self-adaptive. The polling rates on different contexts are also handled differently in the dynamic mode because of the differences among context properties. In addition, GoCity is composed of, but not limited to, four sub-applications. Each sub-application employs a variety of context information and can be implemented as an independent mobile application. Regarding usability, GoCity focuses on providing a simple and clear user interface as well as supporting user expectations for personalization. An experiment which involves a person visiting the city of Victoria was conducted to evaluate GoCity. In this evaluation, three determining factors of usability were employed to qualitatively and quantitatively assess GoCity. In addition, the static mode and dynamic mode were evaluated separately.",Q Yang,University of Vectoria,Thesis,2012,Query,,,,,,,,,,x,,,

technique to output a personalized adaptive mechanism that enables learners to study, and
review learning content efficiently. PACARD address the problems of mobile learning app

prolonged screen time. More specifically, this interface has a flexible card-based design,
which is compatible with various types of mobile devices thus overcoming the screen size

Empirical studies were conducted with about 170,000 online users to evaluate PACARD’s
effect on learners’ engagement and memory retention. In terms of memory retention and
users' preference in PACARD, it results in better retention and enables the learning items to

This has resulted in different shapes and types of antenna design in order to achieve different antenna characteristic. One attractive approach to the design of antennas is to suppress or attenuate harmonic contents due to the non-linear operation of the Radio Frequency (RF) front end. The objectives of this work were to investigate, design and implement antennas for harmonic suppression with the aid of a genetic algorithm (GA). Several microstrip patch antennas were designed to operate at frequencies 1.0, 1.8 and 2.4 GHz respectively. The microstrip patch antenna with stub tuned microstrip lines was also employed at 1.0 and 1.8 GHz to meet the design objectives. A new sensing patch technique is introduced and applied in order to find the accepted power at harmonic frequencies. The evaluation of the measured power accepted at the antenna feed port was done using an electromagnetic (EM) simulator, Ansoft Designer, in terms of current distribution. A two sensors method is presented on one antenna prototype to estimate the accepted power at three frequencies. The computational method is based on an integral equation solver using adaptive surface meshing driven by a genetic algorithm. Several examples are demonstrated, including design of coaxially-fed, air-dielectric patch antennas implanted with shorting and folded walls. The characteristics of the antennas in terms of the impedance responses and far field radiation patterns are discussed. The results in terms of the radiation performance are addressed, and compared to measurements. The presented results of these antennas show a good impedance matching at the fundamental frequency with good suppression achieved at the second and third harmonic frequencies.","Bin-Melha, Mohammed S.", University of Bradford,PhD thesis,2014,Query,,,,,,,,,,x,,,

in time. It has been used in multiple forms to reduce stress, anxiety, and even depression.
Promoting Mindfulness can be done in various ways, but current research shows a trend
towards preferential usage of breathing exercises over other methods to reach a mindful
state. Studies have showcased that breathing can be used as a tool to promote brain control,
specifically in the auditory cortex region. Research pertaining to disorders such as Tinnitus,
the phantom awareness of sound, could potentially benefit from using these brain control
strategies as the auditory cortex is suspected of being the region in the brain responsible for
the production of symptoms associated with Tinnitus. Mobile Applications have become
an increasingly popular tool, due to their accessibility, that can be used to promote mindfulness,
and as a result help patients cope better with Tinnitus. Using applications to guide
patient’s breathing patterns could be a more desirable and effective method to attaining a
more mindful state. This study explores the effectiveness of such an application, and how
the application can modified to be adaptive towards each individual user. Two questionnaires,
Attentional Control Scale (ACS) and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS),
are used to measure self-reported attentional control and mindfulness. The results obtained
from the questionnaires along with number of times the application was used, were used
to determine which features, and whether using the application more times, had an effect
on a participant’s mindful score. Machine learning regression trees and ANOVA was used
as part of the analysis, but due to lack of data, concrete conclusions on whether using the
application more times has a better affect on a participant’s mindfulness could not be established.

218,"Adaptive mobile computation offloading for data stream applications
","In recent times mobile applications are becoming increasingly rich in terms of the functionalities they provide to the end users. Such applications might be very popular among users but there execution may result in draining of many of the device end resources. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) provides a better way of executing such applications by offloading certain parts of the application to cloud. At the first place, computation offloading looks quite promising in terms of saving device end resources but eventually turn out to be expensive if carried out in a static manner. Changes in device end resources and environment variables may have huge impacts on the efficiency of offloading techniques and may even reduce the quality of service for applications involving the use of real time information. In order to overcome this problem, we propose an adaptive computation offloading framework for data stream applications wherein applications are partitioned dynamically followed by being offloaded depending upon the device end resources, network conditions and cloud resources. We also propose an algorithm that depicts the work flow of our computation model. The proposed model is simulated using the CloudSim simulator. In the end, we illustrate the working of our proposed system along with the simulated results.",Abhirup Khanna ; Archana Kero ; Devendra Kumar ; Amit Agarwal,"3rd International Conference on Advances in Computing,Communication & Automation (ICACCA) (Fall)",Conference,2017,Query,yes,yes,no,x,,,,,,,,,
